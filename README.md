# M1_CHALLENGE
Within this repo is the Module 1 Challenge.
The code in this repo is one in which elements of loan data is analyzed using the application of methods learned in the first module of the course such as lists, dictionaries, and automation functions such as def and iterators such as for loops.
This was a simulation for an instance in which I was acting as a dev for a lending startup.
Most of the challenges I faced were in small coding errors on my part. 
However, I am still unable to get the loan.values() for the csv file I attempted to write to work.
Due to time constraints, I will have to figure out the source of that issue at a later date.
Besides that, the over all code works effectively.
